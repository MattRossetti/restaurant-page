# Basement Kitchen Restaurant Page!

## Project Link

## Project Overview
This project is part of The Odin Project's Full stack Javascript course. The task was to create a website for a restaurant. I have an instagram account dedicated to food I cook, so pictures from the instagram were used for website.

## Lessons Learned
The goal of this project was to become familiar with webpack, and use it to minify several different javascript scripts into one file. I use a different script to render each of the different website tabs (about, food menu, and drink menu). Webpack then minifies and compiles all the code into one file. This is very helpful when dealing with many different JS modules.

## Potential improvements
[] Webpack's online documentation has support for an image compressor, I'd like to implement this in the future as there is currently a small delay before the pictures load.
